## Introduction:
This Telegram bot is created to give users bus arrival timings in Singapore without the need to use 
applications such as Singabus or MyTransport.SG. Users can share their current location or type in keywords of
their location to receive a list of nearby bus stops. Frequently visited bus stops can be added to favourites
by users in order to view the bus arrival timings of those bus stops more conveniently. 

If you take a bus at a specific time daily (to go to school/work etc.), you can schedule a message which will be sent
at a specific time daily (depending on your schedules) to better plan your transport journey. You can also view
MRT updates in the event of a train breakdown/delay, where shuttle bus services and additional travelling time 
information will be available. 

Note that since this bot is hosted on Heroku with a free plan, the bot may take a while to start up from 2345 SGT 
to 0515 SGT daily (for about 15 to 20 seconds). Aiyo, go out so late & wake up so early for what! Go sleep. Haha...

Alternatively, you can directly type in a bus stop code (14141) / bus number (80) / keywords of current location 
(Vivocity).

Click on a bus stop code you are looking for. The location of the bus stop and the bus arrival timings of the bus stop 
will be sent to you. 

By default, the message will be in General Format - only the next bus timing will be shown. 
You can refresh the bus arrival timings by clicking on the 'Refresh' button.

Green represents presence of seats, yellow represents there are standing space available while red represents limited seating.

A wheelchair emoji will be present if the bus is wheel-chair accessible.

If there is any MRT breakdowns/delays, a message like this will be sent to users. This occurred on 28 Dec, when there 
is a signalling fault along Downtown Line. Shuttle bus information will be included in the message as well if applicable.

To schedule a message to receive the bus timings at a specific time daily, click on the 
'Schedule Message' button. Next, send a 5 digit bus stop code. Select the buses that you want their timings to be sent 
to you. If you click 'Confirm' without selecting any bus stops, by default, all bus timings will be sent. 
You can select up to 5 buses in one scheduled message. When prompted to key in a time, type in a time that 
follows the 24 hr format (e.g. 0630 to represent 6:30AM) and submit. Do note that when you are scheduling a message, 
you have to complete the entire process (enter bus stop code and timing). You will not be allowed to check bus timings 
while scheduling message. To stop, send /exit.

To view all your scheduled messages, click on the 'View Scheduled Messages' button. You can remove a schedule by 
clicking on the 'Remove' button.

The default option is 'Yes'.

## Feedbacks

Do note that once you send /feedback, you are required to give a feedback. To quit, send /exit.
